#### Exploring Space Like Never Before

Imagine you’re on a mission, trying to fix something crucial, and it’s like Monday-level bad. You drop the wrench for the hundredth time and are about ready to lose it. **But just like SpaceX’s giant “chopsticks” catching rockets mid-air with flawless precision, robots swoop in to save the day!** Instead of stressing, you’re watching them take over while you sip your coffee (or maybe some cosmic-colored space juice). These machines don’t complain — they just get the job done. Now, they’re in your place, navigating the unforgiving terrain, tackling tasks no human could safely handle. It’s the ultimate dream team, pushing exploration to new heights.

Space exploration has evolved beyond human astronauts and spacecraft. Today, robots are at the forefront, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in space. These machines are designed to handle the harsh, unforgiving environments of space, making them essential to future exploration missions.

#### 1.1 Scope

A specific kind of robot known as a “space robot” may carry out tasks in space such as space exploration, external vehicle operations, scientific research, and other tasks that humans cannot perform. The conventional methods of space travel, on-orbit building, on-orbit maintenance, and planetary exploration are progressively being replaced by space robots. It is a crucial means of enabling both manned and unmanned space flights in the future. Since space robots will be operating in an environment that is very different from Earth, designing, fabricating, and controlling these devices will be difficult.

#### 1.2 What are the basic roles of Space Robots?

**Exploring:** Robots can explore planets, moons, and asteroids, and gather data from previously unexplored areas like Curiosity and Perseverance

**Experimenting:** Robots can perform scientific experiments and research inside a space station.

**Maintaining:** Robots can repair spacecraft and satellites, and perform on-orbit maintenance like Canadarm2

**Constructing:** Future robots may help build new structures and habitats or lunar bases.

**Collecting:** Robots can collect samples and extract resources or collect detailed imagery and atmospheric data to help scientists under the celestial bodies.

**Inspecting:** Robots can perform in-depth examinations of soil, rock formations, and atmospheric conditions.

**Navigating:** Robots can move through complex terrain and autonomously navigate spacecraft surfaces that humans can’t reach.

**Transmitting data:** Robots can transmit real-time data to a science base.

#### 1.3 What are the main areas of interest in space robots development?

According to the Space Robotics Technical Committee of [IEEE Robotics and Automation Society](https://www.ieee-ras.org/). The two main areas of interest are Microgravity and Planetary Robotics.

The Space Robotics Technical Committee has two main areas of interest: Microgravity and Planetary Robotics. Microgravity Robotics includes manipulation and mobility for scenarios such as International Space Station (ISS) operations and satellite servicing. Planetary Robot systems address scenarios such as Mars and lunar exploration using manipulation or mobility on or near the surface. Some scenarios, such as asteroid and comet exploration, have environments with low gravity which may blur the distinctions between these categories.

#### 1.3.1 Microgravity Robotics

When large space mechanisms such as satellite antennae work in space, they are in the microgravity environment.

The space environment presents distinct challenges for microgravity robotics, including factors such as radiation, sensitivity to contamination, and extreme thermal conditions, which significantly impact robotic systems and their algorithms. Nevertheless, the field of robotics is anticipated to gain greater significance in the forthcoming years, especially as opportunities for collaboration between humans and robots, as well as among robots themselves, emerge in the context of space exploration. Key focus areas for this technical committee encompass:

· Electromechanical design and control systems.

· Locomotion strategies in microgravity.

· Machine vision technologies for inspection and assembly, addressing harsh lighting, glare, glint, and deep shadows.

· Command and control interfaces, including modes of teleoperation.

· Development of power sources and techniques for recharging consumables.

· Strategies for radiation hardening and its impact on processing efficiency.

· Considerations related to thermal management in the design of space robots.

##### 1.3.1a Canadarm2

Canadarm2 is part of Canada’s contribution to the International Space Station (ISS). This 17-metre-long **robotic arm** was extensively involved in the assembly of the orbiting laboratory. Canadarm2 can be controlled by astronauts on board the ISS. It can also be operated by the ground team at the CSA headquarters or NASA.

**How it works?**

he Canadarm2 is equipped with identical “hands” at both ends, referred to as Latching End Effectors. These components are designed with cables that contract to provide a secure grip. This functionality enables the robotic arm to effectively hold objects or connect itself to the Space Station.

**How does it move?**

Canadarm2 can be directed to navigate seamlessly around the International Space Station (ISS). Each end of the arm serves as an anchoring point while the opposite end performs different functions. To secure the anchoring end, it must be attached to a power data grapple fixture, which is strategically positioned at several critical locations on the Station’s outer framework. Each grapple fixture offers: the necessary power for the arm’s operation. Canadarm2 is capable of moving in an end-over-end manner, linking to these fixtures as it traverses the exterior of the ISS.

##### 1.3.1b Astrobee

Astrobee, NASA’s new free-flying robotic system, will help astronauts reduce the time they spend on routine duties, leaving them to focus more on the things that only humans can do. Working autonomously or via remote control by astronauts, flight controllers or researchers on the ground, the robots are designed to complete tasks such as taking inventory, documenting experiments conducted by astronauts with their built-in cameras or working together to move cargo throughout the station.

**How do they look and work?**

The Astrobee system consists of three cubed-shaped robots, software and a docking station used for recharging. The robots use electric fans as a propulsion system that allows them to fly freely through the microgravity environment of the station. Cameras and sensors help them to “see” and navigate their surroundings. The robots also carry a perching arm that allows them to grasp station handrails to conserve energy or to grab and hold items

##### 1.3.1c Robonaut 2

A Robonaut is a dexterous humanoid robot built and designed at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Our challenge is to build machines that can help humans work and explore in space. Working side by side with humans, or going where the risks are too great for people, Robonauts will expand our ability for construction and discovery.

**Features**

R2 is a state-of-the-art highly dexterous anthropomorphic robot. Like its predecessor Robonaut 1 (R1), R2 is capable of handling a wide range of EVA tools and interfaces, but R2 is a significant advancement over its predecessor. R2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than R1, is more compact, is more dexterous, and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing. Advanced technology spans the entire R2 system and includes: optimized overlapping dual arm dexterous workspace, series elastic joint technology, extended finger and thumb travel, miniaturized 6-axis load cells, redundant force sensing, ultra-high speed joint controllers, extreme neck travel, and high-resolution camera and IR systems.

##### 1.3.1d Dextre

Dextre is a versatile robot that maintains the International Space Station (ISS). Part of Canada’s contribution to the Station, it is the most sophisticated space robot ever built.

**How does it work?**

Dextre was built with a physique that could move in a variety of ways.

Its seven arm joints can rotate, move side to side, and go up and down. Dextre is really capable of doing more intricate movements than a human arm because of its wide range of motion.

The robot can feel touch in a way that humans do! Like Swiss Army knives, its hands function. Every hand possesses:

A retractable motorized wrench for power, data, and video connection; a camera and lighting for up-close inspection; and a retractable connector
The robot is capable of gently grasping fragile equipment without endangering it. Dextre is powerful enough to manage appliances the size of refrigerators, but it can also handle appliances the size of toasters. Dextre’s work can even be precise.

**How does it move?**

This multi-talented robot can ride on the end of Canadarm2 to move from worksite to worksite or be ferried on the Mobile Base System. Dextre can work almost anywhere on the ISS.

#### 1.3.2 Planetary Robotics

Like space, other planets than Earth are hostile environments too, and sending astronauts to explore them has so far been too risky. Once again robots are the best choice to overcome this impediment. For example, many of the things we know about Mars have been discovered by Mars Rovers that autonomously move and investigate this planet’s surface.

For Planetary Robotics, the surface environment also poses unique challenges. These include Microgravity Robotics’ issues during the cruise phase, or if an atmosphere is not present. Further, there is usually the greater uncertainty of interacting with an unexplored natural terrain instead of man-made structures. Planetary Robotics technical topics include:

* Sensing and perception for planetary exploration, including terrain-relative precision position estimation.
* Above-surface, surface, and sub-surface planetary mobility, possibly from novel vehicle design concepts.
* Command and control with limited bandwidth, often precluding teleoperation and requiring autonomous surface operations, with natural terrain navigation and 8 manipulation.
* Planetary rovers systems engineering.
* Testing and qualification, including field tests on Earth and Mars.
* Human-robot system design and development.

##### 1.3.2a Curiosity rover

Part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission, Curiosity, was the largest and most capable rover ever sent to Mars when it launched in 2011. Curiosity set out to answer the question: Did Mars ever have the right environmental conditions to support small life forms called microbes?

##### Mars Curiosity: Facts and Information

**Special Features of the rover**

Curiosity is about 3 metres (10 feet) long and weighs about 900 kg (2,000 pounds), which makes it the longest and heaviest rover on Mars. (By contrast, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, are 1.6 metres [5.2 feet] long and weigh 174 kg [384 pounds].) Unlike previous rovers, Curiosity did not have its landing cushioned by airbags; rather, because of its large size, it was lowered to the surface by three tethers from the spacecraft’s body, called the sky crane.

NASA’s Curiosity rover landed on Mars on Aug. 5, 2012, inside Gale Crater, which lies on the boundary between Mars’ cratered southern highlands and its smooth, northern plains.

##### 1.3.2b Perseverance rover

The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover searches for signs of ancient microbial life, to advance NASA’s quest to explore the past habitability of Mars. The rover is collecting core samples of Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and soil), for potential pickup by a future mission that would bring them to Earth for detailed study.

Perseverance has a similar design to its predecessor rover, Curiosity, although it was moderately upgraded. It carries seven primary payload instruments, nineteen cameras, and two microphones.

The rover also carried the mini-helicopter Ingenuity to Mars, an experimental technology testbed that made the first powered aircraft flight on another planet on April 19, 2021. On January 18, 2024 (UTC), it made its 72nd and final flight, suffering damage on landing to its rotor blades, possibly all four, causing NASA to retire it.


**Special Features of the Rover**

The Perseverance rover will search for signs of ancient microbial life, which will advance NASA’s quest to explore the past habitability of Mars.

· Landing site: The rover landed in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide ancient lake bed and river delta on Mars. The landing site was challenging because it was covered in sand dunes, steep cliffs, boulders, and small craters.

· Ingenuity helicopter: The rover is accompanied by a small helicopter named Ingenuity, which is designed to be the first powered flight on another planet

· Sample caching: The rover uses a drill to gather samples from Martian rocks and soil, which it stores in tubes on the surface. This process is called “sample caching”.

· Other components like Mars Microphone, durable wheels, robotic arm, cameras, and autonomous capability.

##### 1.3.2c InSight Lander

The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission was a robotic lander designed to study the deep interior of the planet Mars. Lockheed Martin Space manufactured it, was managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). InSight was operational on Mars from November 2018 until December 2022.

InSight Lander was the first mission to study in depth the inner space of Mars: its crust, mantle, and core. But InSight was more than a Mars mission. It studied processes that shaped the rocky planets more than four billion years ago. The mission ended in December 2022.

**How did InSight Work?**

With two solar arrays powering the spacecraft’s instruments and a robotic arm, InSight was designed to be modelled after NASA’s Phoenix lander. With its solar panels installed, InSight was roughly 6 meters (20 feet) broad and 1 meter (3 feet) tall.
InSight’s primary science experiments were a heat-flow probe named HP3, which was intended to bury itself up to five meters below the surface in order to gather temperature measurements, and a seismometer called SEIS, which measured Marsquakes. Soon after arriving, InSight placed both on the surface using its robotic arm.

A magnitude 4.7 earthquake was the biggest one that SEIS could find. The waves produced by earthquakes on Mars differ from those on Earth and the Moon, suggesting that either the highest layers of Mars may be severely broken or that the quakes originate from deep within the planet.

Because of the unique nature of the soil at InSight’s landing site, the HP3 temperature probe, often known as the mole, was unable to burrow below the surface due to insufficient friction. NASA said in January 2020 that it was officially abandoning the mole dig project, following nearly two years of work with InSight’s robotic arm.

##### 1.3.2d Yutu-2 (China)

Yutu-2, or Jade Rabbit-2, is a robotic rover that landed on the far side of the moon in January 2019 as part of China’s Chang’e-4 mission. Yutu-2 is the longest-working lunar rover. The name “Yutu” symbolizes kindness, purity, agility, and China’s peaceful use of space.

Yutu-2 is currently operational as the longest-lived lunar rover after it eclipsed (on 20 November 2019) the previous lunar longevity record of 321 Earth days held by Soviet Union’s Lunokhod 1 rover. Yutu-2 is the first lunar rover ever to have traversed the far side of the Moon. By January 2022, it had travelled a distance of more than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) along the Moon’s surface.

The landing site is within the Von Kármán crater(180 km or 110 mi diameter) in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the Moon, which was previously unexplored by landers. The site has symbolic as well as scientific value: Theodore von Kármán was the PhD advisor of Qian Xuesen, the founder of the Chinese space program.

#### 1.3.3 Orbital Robotics

Because the space industry produces gear that is incredibly sensitive and sophisticated, many jobs related to satellite repair and operations aboard the International Space Station are difficult for humans to perform. In addition, space is a hostile environment, thus this task can be risky or insufficient for us. Robotic solutions are an excellent option for resolving these complex issues. Certain jobs that need to be completed in space are urgent and repeated, in addition to being hazardous and challenging procedures. With these, robots might be helpful as well.

The space environment, which includes high radiation levels, abrupt temperature changes, and no gravity, presents special difficulties for Orbital Robotics in the design and production of these robots. Every component, element, and subsystem needs to be designed with survival and space operation in mind. The difficulty doesn’t end here; all of the software that will govern the robot’s actions and motions must also be specifically created for space. Robots are utilized in space on a daily basis despite these difficulties, and their significance is only projected to grow over the next several years.

Exhaustive lists of possible applications of robotic on-orbit servicing are found in which can summarized as follows:

· Assembly, maintenance and repair.

· Spacecraft deployment, release and retrieve.

· Extravehicular activity support.

· Inspection

· Refueling and Multi-arms cooperation.

##### 1.3.3a GeoFlow Experiment (ESA)

It used robotic systems to simulate Earth’s core dynamics in microgravity, operating aboard the ISS.The GeoFlow Experiment is a fluid dynamics experiment conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) under microgravity conditions, specifically led by the European Space Agency (ESA). It simulates the flow of fluids inside planetary interiors, mimicking the dynamics of Earth’s core.

**Purpose**

The primary goal is to understand how Earth’s molten core behaves and its impact on phenomena like the planet’s magnetic field.

**Key Features**

Uses an electrically charged fluid to simulate core dynamics.
Observes complex fluid patterns impossible to replicate on Earth due to gravity.

**Working of GeoFlow Experiment:**

The GeoFlow Experiment simulates the movement of Earth’s molten core by using a spherical cavity filled with electrically conductive fluid. Electric fields are applied to induce fluid motion, mimicking the convective flows that occur in planetary cores. The system replicates phenomena like the generation of Earth’s magnetic field (dynamo effect).

**Role of Robotics:**

Robotics aboard the ISS play a critical role in monitoring, adjusting, and maintaining the experiment. Automated systems control the fluid dynamics setup, gather data in microgravity, and ensure precise operation without direct human intervention, enhancing experimental reliability.

##### 1.3.3b European Robotic Arm (ERA)

It is mounted on the ISS, this robotic arm helps with payload manipulation and maintenance outside the Russian segment. It is the first robotic arm that is able to work on the Russian Segment of the station. The arm supplements the two Russian Strela cargo cranes that were originally installed on the Pirs module but were later moved to the docking compartment Poisk and Zarya module

**Working of the European Robotic Arm (ERA):**

The European Robotic Arm (ERA) is designed to handle tasks outside the Russian segment of the ISS. It can move payloads, install new components, and support spacewalks by moving astronauts and equipment. With 7 degrees of freedom, the arm is highly flexible, able to “walk” between different locations on the station.

**Role of Robotics:**

ERA is fully automated but can be controlled manually from inside or outside the ISS. Its autonomy reduces the need for astronaut involvement, increases precision, and ensures safe handling of delicate tasks, optimizing ISS operations.

##### 1.3.3c OSAM-1

OSAM-1 (On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing-1) is a NASA mission set to launch in the mid-2020s. Its goal is to extend the life of satellites and spacecraft by performing repairs, refueling, and repositioning while in orbit. OSAM-1 is equipped with advanced robotic systems that enable it to carry out these complex tasks autonomously.

**Working and Role of Robotics:**

Robotic arms aboard OSAM-1 will conduct delicate operations like cutting wires, removing covers, and refueling satellites. These precise robotic systems allow spacecraft to be serviced without human presence, enhancing satellite longevity and reducing space debris.

##### 1.3.4 Asteroid Probes and Robotics

The Asteroid Redirect Mission was intended to develop a robotic spacecraft to visit a large near-Earth asteroid and collect a multi-ton boulder from its surface. It would then redirect the boulder into orbit around the moon, where astronauts would have explored it and returned to Earth with samples.

Multiple recent missions have greatly increased our understanding of the nature and diversity of asteroids. These missions have included Galileo which flew by asteroids Gaspra and Ida, the NEAR rendezvous mission to 433 Eros, the Deep Space 1 flyby of Braille in 1998, the Hayabusa (Muses-C) mission to 25143 Itokawa in 2003, Rosetta’s flyby of 2867 Steins last year (2008) and planned flyby of 21 Lutetia in 2010, and Dawn’s planned rendezvous’ with Ceres (2011) and Vesta (2015). However, only two of these missions — NEAR and Hayabusa — have ventured to the point of touching the surface, and then only minimally and without detailed in-situ surface characterization capabilities.

**Some features of asteroid robotics include:**

* **Ruggedized design:** Robots designed to withstand radiation, extreme temperatures, and high accelerations during space launch
* **Climbing capabilities:** Robots that can go where other robots cannot
* **Modular grippers:** Robots that can traverse any terrain
* **Modular payload bay and attachments:** Robots that can carry out a wide range of missions
* **Advanced path planning and swarm coordination capabilities:** Robots that can carry out inspection routines and data collection with minimal human oversight
* **Shape-shifting:** Softbots, or Area-of-Effect Softbots (AoES), are shape-shifting spacecraft that could be used to land on asteroids
* **Jump motion characteristics:** Quadruped robots have the potential to serve as explorers of asteroid surfaces because their jump motion characteristics are suitable for the irregular and weak gravitational fields of asteroids

##### 1.3.4a Hayabusa2 (JAXA)

Hayabusa2 studied the asteroid Ryugu, collected samples, and brought them to Earth. The spacecraft is now on an extended mission to the asteroid 1998KY26.Hayabusa2 is a Japanese spacecraft that explored asteroid Ryugu (162173) from June 2018 to November 2019. It dispatched a series of landers and a penetrator, and it collected multiple samples from the asteroid.

JAXA launched Hayabusa2 in December 2014 to collect samples from Ryugu. After arriving at the asteroid in June 2018, Hayabusa2 deployed two rovers and a small lander on the surface. Then, on Feb. 22, 2019, Hayabusa2 fired an impactor into the asteroid to create an artificial crater. This allowed the spacecraft to retrieve a sample beneath Ryugu’s surface.

#### 1.4 The Future of Space Robotics
Space robotics is poised to revolutionize how we explore and operate beyond Earth. As we push farther into the cosmos, robots will become essential for tasks humans can’t perform or where human presence is limited. Future robotics will be more autonomous, intelligent, and capable of adapting to dynamic environments, whether on distant planets, in microgravity environments, or orbiting Earth. From exploring Mars and mining asteroids to building habitats and servicing satellites, these advanced machines will shape the future of space exploration, extending human reach across the solar system.

When it comes to planetary robotics, future planetary robots will go beyond surface exploration, advancing in autonomy and scientific capability. For example, NASA’s Dragonfly mission (2027) will send a rotorcraft to Titan (Saturn’s moon), where it will fly across diverse landscapes autonomously, analyzing the environment and searching for signs of life.

Microgravity robots, such as Astrobee aboard the International Space Station (ISS), will become more capable of autonomous operations, assisting astronauts in day-to-day tasks like monitoring environmental conditions or conducting experiments.

NASA’s OSAM-1 (On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing-1) mission will set the stage for robotic systems capable of refueling, repairing, and repositioning satellites, extending their operational lifetimes and reducing the need for new launches.

Asteroid mining and exploration are future frontiers for robotic technology. Missions like NASA’s DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) have already demonstrated the potential for robotic systems to alter the course of near-Earth objects. Future asteroid robots will not only conduct sample collection but also mine asteroids for valuable resources such as water, metals, and rare minerals.

#### 1.5 Conclusion
The future of space robotics is bright, with advancements in autonomy, artificial intelligence, and robotics technology enabling missions that were once thought impossible. These machines will serve as humanity’s tools for exploring, building, and operating in space, ultimately expanding our presence beyond Earth and unlocking the potential of the solar system. From planetary surfaces to orbiting satellites, microgravity environments, and asteroid mining, robotics will play a critical role in shaping the next era of space exploration.
